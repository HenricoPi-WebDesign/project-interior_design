(3)      Logging on as a registered user will provide access to fee and non-fee carrying services on the CIPC website.

(4)      Before accessing any fee carrying services on the CIPC website, the user will be required to make a deposit into a virtual account created for him/her by CIPC. (For the various instruments available for depositing funds into the virtual account, refer to Paragraph 15) unless if the virtual account balance is sufficient to cover the cost of the service.

(5)      Customers should note that depositing large amounts of money into the organisation’s bank account, and not utilising all the funds in their account over a 1 (one) month period constitutes a breach or contravention of the Banks Act, 1990 (as amended).

(6)      In light of the above and the risk this poses to CIPC, customers will only be allowed to deposit amounts which match the volume of transactions to be performed in that month.

(7)      A customer can view or print a full record of a transaction that is maintained for a period of one (1) month on the CIPC website.
</p>



<br><br><br>
<li><h2><b>15 Payment instruments for advance pre-payment method</b></h2></li>
<br>
<p>
(1)      Credit card 
No credit card payments will be accepted by CIPC for advance pre-payment method.

(2)      Direct deposits 
When using the advance pre-payment method, via direct deposits, such option is subjected to the following rules:

(a)      The payment must be identified by supplying the customer code in the reference section of the deposit slip or on the electronic transfer - This information will enable CIPC to identify the deposit and allocate it to the correct virtual account;

(b)      No transfers must be made from ATM's as it does not support the supply of the reference number;

(c)      No cheque deposits accepted;

(d)      The customer’s virtual account will only be updated when CIPC receives confirmation of the deposit by means of an electronic bank statement - This will typically happen on the next working day. Payments made by a customer from a bank other than ABSA, confirmation of payment may take up to 3 (three) working days.
</p>



<br><br><br>
<li><h2><b>16 Refunds for advance pre-payment method</b></h2></li>
<br>
<p>
(1)      Deposits into a customer’s CIPC account are refundable, but not transferable.

(3)      A customer referred to in subparagraph (2) may apply to CIPC in writing for a refund if he/she -

(a)      wishes to terminate his/her registration as a customer; or

(b)      Is informed that his/her requested service will not be rendered and he/she does not wish to retain the money he/she deposited into his/her CIPC account or the remainder thereof for later use.

(4)      If a customer requests the incorrect service, selects the incorrect enterprise for a disclosure, submit the incorrect type of form, supply incorrect information when submitting a form, made a typing error or spelling error, etc. and CIPC renders the service, CIPC shall not be liable to refund the fee concerned.

(5)      If the delivery of the rendered service fails without CIPC being aware thereof, CIPC will first be offered the opportunity of delivering the service (produce a confirmation certificate or certificate disclosure) before any claim for credit notes by the customer concerned will be entertained.

(6)      No submissions or disclosures can be refunded by CIPC without proof that the submission was unsuccessful due to an error (human or otherwise) attributable to CIPC or proof that the disclosure failed in a substantive way.

(7)      Refunding referred to in subparagraph (2) will be done by CIPC within 30 (thirty) days in a manner to be agreed upon between CIPC and the customer concerned.

<li><h2><b>17 Online payment or "pay-as-you-go" model</b></h2></li>
<br>
<p>
Subject to paragraph 15, the "pay-as-you-go" model makes provision for three types of online payment options, namely immediate credit/debit card payments via 3D Secure payment portal, EFT or cash deposit using a payment reference instead of an customer code as with the advance pre-payment method.
</p>



<br><br><br>
<li><h2><b>18 Credit/debit card payment for "pay-as-you-go" Model</b></h2></li>
<br>
<p>
(1)      Where payment is made by credit card, CIPC may require additional information in order to authorise and/or verify the validity of payment. Customers warrant that they are fully authorised to use the credit card supplied for purposes of paying for services. Customers also warrant that the credit card has sufficient funds to cover all the costs incurred as a result of the services used on any of the CIPC channels.

(2)      CIPC only accept Visa and Master credit cards.  American Express and Diners Club cards have been excluded as payment methods.

(3)      All debit cards will are accepted. Please note that in order to make the payment for services by debit card, you have to be linked to an internet banking system.

(4)      Any challenges with the online payment must be referred to the support service of your bank.

(5)      Any dispute concerning the funds withdrawal or crediting of funds to your bank card must first be referred to CIPC before a credit card is chargeback by your bank.

(6)      Only 3D Secure/Secure Code technology enable cards will be accepted. If your bank has no appropriate certificate to use this technology, your payment via the payment system will not be processed.
</p>



<br><br><br>
<li><h2><b>19 Security Policy for “pay-as-you-go” Model</b></h2></li>
<br>
<p>
(1)      Payment by credit or debit card is made through the website of the electronic payment system. Security of payments through payment portal is ensured by Secure Sockets Layer protocol (SSL) used for confidential information transmission from a customer to the payment portal server for further processing. Further transmission of information is carried out via the closed banking networks which are practically impossible to penetrate.

(2)      The processing of confidential customer information (credit card numbers, cardholder, expiration date etc.) is done in the processing center of the bank that is contracted to provide services to CIPC. Thus, nobody, not even a seller, can receive the customer's personal and credit card data, including information on his/her purchases.

(3)      The safety of the payment procedure is ensured by traffic encryption (SSL).

Features of payment via Visa Electron and Master cards:

(4)      Customers must make sure that card has a CVV2 (CVC2) code, located on the back of your card.

(5)      All transactions are encrypted using appropriate encryption technology.
</p>



<br><br><br>
<li><h2><b>20 Refunds for "pay-as-you-go" model</b></h2></li>
<br>
<p>
(1)      For any refunds, customers need to submit a written application to CIPC together with a scanned copy of the owner of the card by logging an online ticket via http://enquiries.cipc.co.za/Index.aspx. The amount of money paid for the service will be refunded.

(2)      It is important to note that customers will only be refunded in the event that CIPC is unable to provide the required services. In case of payment by banking card, the amount of money due to you will be refunded to your card.
</p>



<br><br><br>
<li><h2><b>21 Agreement of sale for all payment methods</b></h2></li>
<br>
<p>
(1)      The agreement of sale, whereby CIPC can proceed to deduct the fee concerned from a customer’s CIPC account in order to render the requested service, is concluded at the time when and place where the CIPC receives such customer’s acceptance.

(2)      Acceptance referred to in subparagraph (1) will occur at the moment the customer selects the “Proceed with request” option.

(3)      Receipt by CIPC referred to in subparagraph (1) will occur when CIPC electronically (via the CIPC website) informs the customer concerned that his/her request has been received.
</p>



<br><br><br>
<li><h2><b>22 Suspension of accounts</b></h2></li>

</p>



<br><br><br>
